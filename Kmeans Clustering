I am applying unsupervised machine learning methods onto my thesis dataset, I have three targets and three parameters 
which we will use to estimate the targets.  


import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

#reading in some thesis data
data = pd.read_csv("F:/Thesis/Pandas_csv/All_data.csv", sep = ",")

#setting the data up for the algorithm, we're trying to use the three parameters TSS, TP, and Chl-conc to estimate the zone we sampled in
mldata = data[['TSS', 'TP', 'Chl-conc', 'Zone']]

mldata = mldata.dropna()

X = mldata[['TSS', 'TP', 'Chl-conc]]

y = mldata['Zone']



#I only have three targets, which are the three different zones that we sampled in. I am trying to predict which zone we sampled in based 
on the values of the parameters at a sampling point, there are 26 sampling points total, in three different zones. 
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state = 5)

kmeans.fit(X)

#plotting our model output
